## Peer-graded Assignment: Statistical Inference Course Project (Course 6)
\  

**The project consists of two parts:**  
1. A simulation exercise.  
2. Basic inferential data analysis.  
\  

#### Task:
\  
You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, ideally you'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf. (I will post a very simple introduction to knitr). However, feel free to use whatever software that you would like to create your pdf.
\  
Each pdf report should be no more than 3 pages with 3 pages of supporting appendix material if needed (code, figures, etcetera).


\  

#### Review criteria:  
\  
1. Did you show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution?
2. Did you show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution?
3. Did you perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
4. Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or tests?
5. Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the context of the problem correctly?
6. Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their conclusions?
